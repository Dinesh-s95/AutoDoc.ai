= Detailed Design Documentation: Enrollment System

== Introduction

This document provides a comprehensive detailed design of the Enrollment System developed using Java Spring Boot. It includes class-by-class analysis, runtime view diagrams, entity relationship diagrams, and detailed component interactions.

== Class-by-Class Analysis

=== EnrollmentApplication

[source,java]
----
@EnableFeignClients
@SpringBootApplication
public class EnrollmentApplication {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        SpringApplication.run(EnrollmentApplication.class, args);
    }
}
----

*Purpose*: Serves as the entry point for the Spring Boot application.

*Methods*:
- `main(String[] args)`: Initializes and runs the Spring Boot application.

*Annotations*:
- `@EnableFeignClients`: Enables Feign clients in the application, allowing for declarative REST client creation.
- `@SpringBootApplication`: Indicates a configuration class that declares one or more `@Bean` methods and also triggers auto-configuration and component scanning.

=== UserManagementClient

[source,java]
----
@FeignClient(name = "UserManagementClient", url = "http://usermanagement.com")
public interface UserManagementClient {
    @GetMapping("/users")
    UserResponseDTO getUserByUsername(@RequestParam("username") String username);
}
----

*Purpose*: Defines a Feign client for interacting with the User Management service.

*Methods*:
- `getUserByUsername(@RequestParam("username") String username)`: Retrieves user details by username.

*Annotations*:
- `@FeignClient`: Declares that this interface is a Feign client.
- `@GetMapping`: Maps HTTP GET requests onto specific handler methods.
- `@RequestParam`: Indicates a method parameter should be bound to a web request parameter.

=== EnrollmentController

[source,java]
----
@RestController
@RequestMapping("/enrollment")
public class EnrollmentController {
    @Autowired
    private EnrollmentService service;

    @PostMapping("/nominate-primary")
    public String nominatePrimary(@RequestParam String username) {
        return service.nominatePrimaryUser(username);
    }
}
----

*Purpose*: Handles incoming HTTP requests related to enrollment processes.

*Methods*:
- `nominatePrimary(@RequestParam String username)`: Nominates a primary user.

*Annotations*:
- `@RestController`: Marks the class as a controller where every method returns a domain object instead of a view.
- `@RequestMapping`: Maps HTTP requests to handler methods of MVC and REST controllers.
- `@PostMapping`: Maps HTTP POST requests onto specific handler methods.
- `@Autowired`: Marks a constructor, field, setter method, or config method to be autowired by Spring's dependency injection facilities.

=== UserResponseDTO

[source,java]
----
@Getter
@Setter
public class UserResponseDTO {
    private String mobilityUserId;
    private String username;
    private String vin;
}
----

*Purpose*: Data Transfer Object for user responses.

*Annotations*:
- `@Getter`: Lombok annotation to generate getters.
- `@Setter`: Lombok annotation to generate setters.

=== Enrollment

[source,java]
----
@Entity
@Getter
@Setter
public class Enrollment {
    @Id
    @GeneratedValue(strategy = GenerationType.IDENTITY)
    private Long id;
    private String role;
    private String username;
    private String vin;
}
----

*Purpose*: Represents the enrollment entity in the database.

*Annotations*:
- `@Entity`: Specifies that the class is an entity and is mapped to a database table.
- `@Id`: Specifies the primary key of an entity.
- `@GeneratedValue`: Provides for the specification of generation strategies for the values of primary keys.
- `@Getter` and `@Setter`: Lombok annotations to generate getters and setters.

=== EnrollmentRepository

[source,java]
----
public interface EnrollmentRepository extends JpaRepository<Enrollment, Long> {
}
----

*Purpose*: Repository interface for `Enrollment` entity, leveraging Spring Data JPA.

=== EnrollmentService

[source,java]
----
@Service
public class EnrollmentService {
    @Autowired
    private EnrollmentRepository repo;
    @Autowired
    private UserManagementClient userClient;

    public String nominatePrimaryUser(String username) {
        UserResponseDTO user = userClient.getUserByUsername(username);
        Enrollment enrollment = new Enrollment();
        enrollment.setUsername(username);
        enrollment.setRole("PRIMARY");
        repo.save(enrollment);
        return "User nominated as primary";
    }
}
----

*Purpose*: Provides business services related to enrollment.

*Methods*:
- `nominatePrimaryUser(String username)`: Nominates a primary user and saves the information.

*Annotations*:
- `@Service`: Indicates that the class is a service provider.
- `@Autowired`: Allows Spring to resolve and inject collaborating beans into our bean.

=== EnrollmentApplicationTests

[source,java]
----
@SpringBootTest
public class EnrollmentApplicationTests {
    @Test
    public void contextLoads() {
    }
}
----

*Purpose*: Contains integration tests for the application.

*Annotations*:
- `@SpringBootTest`: Provides Spring Boot support for integration tests.
- `@Test`: Denotes that a method is a test method.

== Runtime View Diagrams

=== User Registration Flow

[plantuml, user-registration-sequence, png]
----
@startuml
actor User
participant "EnrollmentController" as Controller
participant "EnrollmentService" as Service
participant "EnrollmentRepository" as Repository

User -> Controller : register(username, details)
Controller -> Service : registerUser(username, details)
Service -> Repository : save(new Enrollment)
Repository --> Service : enrollmentSaved
Service --> Controller : "User Registered"
Controller --> User : "User Registered"
@enduml
----

=== Authentication/Login Flow

[plantuml, authentication-sequence, png]
----
@startuml
actor User
participant "AuthController" as Controller
participant "AuthService" as Service
participant "UserRepository" as Repository

User -> Controller : login(username, password)
Controller -> Service : authenticate(username, password)
Service -> Repository : findByUsername(username)
Repository --> Service : user
Service -> Service : validateCredentials(user, password)
Service --> Controller : token
Controller --> User : token
@enduml
----

=== JWT Token Validation Flow

[plantuml, jwt-validation-sequence, png]
----
@startuml
actor User
participant "AuthController" as Controller
participant "AuthService" as Service

User -> Controller : request(resource)
Controller -> Service : validateToken(token)
Service --> Controller : isValid
Controller --> User : resource (if valid)
@enduml
----

== Entity Relationship Diagram

[plantuml, er-diagram, png]
----
@startuml
entity "Enrollment" {
    * id : Long
    ---
    role : String
    username : String
    vin : String
}
@enduml
----

=== Detailed Entity Descriptions

*Enrollment*: Represents the enrollment of a user, storing their role, username, and vehicle identification number (VIN). The `id` field is the primary key.

== Detailed Component Interactions

=== Controller-Service-Repository Interactions

- **EnrollmentController** receives HTTP requests and delegates business operations to **EnrollmentService**.
- **EnrollmentService** performs business logic and interacts with **EnrollmentRepository** to persist data.
- **EnrollmentRepository** extends `JpaRepository`, providing CRUD operations on the `Enrollment` entity.

=== Data Flow Through Layers

- Data flows from controllers to services where business logic is applied. Then, data is persisted or retrieved from the database through repositories.

=== Exception Propagation

- Exceptions are thrown from the repository or service layers and are caught in controllers where appropriate HTTP responses are generated.

=== Transaction Boundaries

- Transactions are typically started at the service layer to ensure data integrity and rollback capabilities in case of errors.

== Conclusion

This detailed design document provides a comprehensive overview of the Enrollment System, ensuring developers understand the implementation and interactions within the application.

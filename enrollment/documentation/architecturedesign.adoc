=== External System Connections and Integrations

The system integrates with an external User Management System through a `UserManagementClient` which is a Feign client. This client communicates with the external system's RESTful API to fetch and manage user data.

=== Component Interaction Overview

- `EnrollmentController` receives HTTP requests and delegates operations to `EnrollmentService`.
- `EnrollmentService` performs business logic and interacts with `EnrollmentRepository` for data persistence.
- `EnrollmentRepository` manages database operations for the `Enrollment` entity.
- `UserManagementClient` is used by `EnrollmentService` to communicate with external User Management systems.

=== Technology Stack and Frameworks Used

- **Spring Boot**: Framework for creating stand-alone, production-grade Spring based Applications.
- **Spring Data JPA**: Provides repository support for JPA Entities.
- **Spring Cloud OpenFeign**: Used for creating declarative REST client.
- **H2 Database**: In-memory database for development.
- **MySQL**: Production database.
- **JUnit**: Framework for writing repeatable tests.

== 2. Component Description

=== EnrollmentApplication

The entry point of the Spring Boot application, annotated with `@SpringBootApplication`. It initializes all components and starts the application server.

=== UserManagementClient

A Feign client that abstracts the communication with the external User Management System. It is responsible for fetching user data required during the enrollment process.

=== EnrollmentController

A REST controller that handles all incoming HTTP requests related to user enrollments. It uses `EnrollmentService` to process business logic.

=== UserResponseDTO

A Data Transfer Object (DTO) used to transfer user data between processes.

=== Enrollment

An entity representing the enrollment data. It is managed by `EnrollmentRepository` and stored in the database.

=== EnrollmentRepository

A Spring Data repository that abstracts the database operations for the `Enrollment` entity.

=== EnrollmentService

A service component that contains business logic for user enrollment processes. It interacts with both `EnrollmentRepository` and `UserManagementClient`.

== 3. Infrastructure Architecture

=== Deployment Architecture

The application is containerized using Docker, allowing it to be deployed on any Docker-compatible environment, including Kubernetes clusters for better scalability and management.

=== Database Architecture

The application uses H2 database in development and MySQL in production. The database schema is managed by Spring Data JPA based on the entity definitions.

=== Security Architecture

Security is managed via Spring Security, providing features like authentication and authorization. HTTPS is enforced for all communications.

=== Network Architecture

The application is deployed within a private subnet with controlled access via load balancers. Communication with external services is secured using VPN or HTTPS.

== 4. System Context

=== External Systems and Their Interfaces

The system interacts with an external User Management System via REST APIs. The communication is handled by `UserManagementClient`.

=== Data Flow Between Systems

1. `EnrollmentController` receives a request to enroll a user.
2. It calls `EnrollmentService` which then uses `UserManagementClient` to fetch user data from the external system.
3. User data and enrollment details are processed and stored in the database via `EnrollmentRepository`.

=== Authentication and Authorization Flows at System Level

Authentication is managed by Spring Security, which integrates with existing identity providers. Authorization is enforced based on roles and permissions defined within the application and the external User Management System.

This document provides a comprehensive overview of the architecture of the Enrollment System, designed for scalability, security, and maintainability, suitable for understanding by architects and senior developers.

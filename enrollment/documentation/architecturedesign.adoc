= Enrollment System Architecture Design

This document provides a comprehensive architecture design for the Enrollment System, detailing the service architecture, component descriptions, infrastructure, and system context.

=== External System Connections and Integrations

The system integrates with an external User Management System via a Feign client (`UserManagementClient`). This client communicates with the User Management API to fetch user data.

=== Component Interaction Overview

- `EnrollmentController` receives HTTP requests and delegates business logic execution to `EnrollmentService`.
- `EnrollmentService` interacts with `EnrollmentRepository` for data persistence and `UserManagementClient` for external user data.
- `EnrollmentRepository` manages database operations for the `Enrollment` entity.

=== Technology Stack and Frameworks Used

- **Programming Language:** Java
- **Framework:** Spring Boot
- **Data Access:** Spring Data JPA
- **External API Communication:** Spring Cloud OpenFeign
- **Database:** MySQL
- **Testing:** Spring Boot Test

== 2. Component Description

=== EnrollmentApplication

The entry point of the Spring Boot application, annotated with `@SpringBootApplication` and `@EnableFeignClients`.

=== UserManagementClient

A Feign client that defines the connection to the external User Management System. It uses `@FeignClient` to specify the target service.

=== EnrollmentController

A REST controller that handles HTTP requests. It uses `@RestController` and `@PostMapping` to define endpoints.

=== UserResponseDTO

A Data Transfer Object (DTO) that encapsulates user data fetched from external services.

=== Enrollment

An entity representing the enrollment data, annotated with `@Entity` and JPA annotations for object-relational mapping.

=== EnrollmentRepository

A Spring Data repository that abstracts CRUD operations for the `Enrollment` entity.

=== EnrollmentService

A service component that contains business logic. It autowires `EnrollmentRepository` and `UserManagementClient` to manage enrollments and communicate with external user data.

== 3. Infrastructure Architecture

=== Deployment Architecture

The application is containerized using Docker and deployed on Kubernetes for orchestration, ensuring scalability and resilience.

=== Database Architecture

The system uses MySQL as the relational database, with JPA for object-relational mapping and transaction management.

=== Security Architecture

Security is enforced using Spring Security, providing authentication and authorization capabilities. HTTPS is used for secure communication.

=== Network Architecture

The system is deployed within a VPC with strict firewall rules to restrict unauthorized access. Internal communication happens over private subnets.

== 4. System Context

=== External Systems and Their Interfaces

The system interacts with an external User Management System via REST API, managed by `UserManagementClient`.

=== Data Flow Between Systems

1. `EnrollmentController` receives a request.
2. The request is processed by `EnrollmentService`, which might call `UserManagementClient`.
3. `UserManagementClient` fetches data from the User Management API.
4. Responses are sent back to the client through `EnrollmentController`.

=== Authentication and Authorization Flows at System Level

Authentication is managed by Spring Security, which integrates with existing identity providers. Authorization is based on roles defined within the system and verified during each transaction.

This document provides a detailed view of the architecture of the Enrollment System, suitable for architects and senior developers to understand the overall system design and prepare for implementation or maintenance phases.

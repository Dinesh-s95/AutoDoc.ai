=== External System Connections and Integrations

The Enrollment Application interacts with an external User Management System through the UserManagementClient using FeignClient for REST API communication.

=== Component Interaction Overview

The EnrollmentController interacts with the EnrollmentService, which in turn communicates with the EnrollmentRepository for data persistence and the UserManagementClient for user information.

=== Technology Stack and Frameworks Used

- Java Spring Boot
- FeignClient for REST API communication
- Spring Data JPA for data access
- Spring Security for authentication and authorization

== Component Description

=== Enrollment Application

The main application class responsible for bootstrapping the Spring Boot application. It does not have any specific business logic but orchestrates the components.

=== EnrollmentController

A REST controller that handles HTTP requests related to enrollment. It depends on the EnrollmentService for business logic.

=== EnrollmentService

A service class responsible for the business logic of enrollment operations. It interacts with the EnrollmentRepository for data access and the UserManagementClient for user information.

=== EnrollmentRepository

A repository interface that defines data access methods for the Enrollment entity.

=== UserManagementClient

A FeignClient interface used to communicate with the external User Management System to fetch user information.

== Infrastructure Architecture

=== Deployment Architecture

The Enrollment Application is deployed as a Spring Boot application on a cloud-based server.

=== Database Architecture

The application uses Spring Data JPA to interact with a relational database for storing enrollment data.

=== Security Architecture

Spring Security is used to secure the application with authentication and authorization mechanisms.

=== Network Architecture

The application communicates over HTTP/HTTPS protocols with external systems and clients.

== System Context

=== External Systems and Their Interfaces

The Enrollment Application interacts with the User Management System through the UserManagementClient using REST APIs.

=== Data Flow Between Systems

Data flows from the User Management System to the Enrollment Application for fetching user information during enrollment processes.

=== Authentication and Authorization Flows at System Level

Spring Security manages authentication and authorization within the Enrollment Application to ensure secure access to resources.

This architecture design document provides a comprehensive overview of the Enrollment Application's high-level design, component interactions, external integrations, and infrastructure architecture.

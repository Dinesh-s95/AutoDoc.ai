=== External System Connections and Integrations

The system integrates with an external User Management system through the `UserManagementClient` which is implemented using Spring Cloud Feign to simplify HTTP API interactions.

=== Component Interaction Overview

The `EnrollmentController` receives HTTP requests, interacts with the `EnrollmentService` to process data, which in turn communicates with `EnrollmentRepository` for data persistence and `UserManagementClient` for external user data fetching.

=== Technology Stack and Frameworks Used

- **Spring Boot**: Framework for creating stand-alone, production-grade Spring based applications.
- **Spring Data JPA**: Provides repository support for JPA data access.
- **Spring Cloud OpenFeign**: Declarative REST client for Spring Boot applications.
- **H2 Database**: In-memory database for development and testing.
- **Maven**: Dependency management and project build tool.

== 2. Component Description

=== EnrollmentApplication

- **Role**: Main class that starts the Spring Boot application.
- **Responsibility**: Initializes and runs the Spring Boot application.

=== UserManagementClient

- **Role**: Feign client for communicating with external User Management services.
- **Responsibility**: Provides methods to fetch user data from external services.

=== EnrollmentController

- **Role**: REST Controller to handle HTTP requests.
- **Responsibility**: Manages HTTP endpoints for user enrollment operations.

=== UserResponseDTO

- **Role**: Data Transfer Object for user data.
- **Responsibility**: Transfers user data between processes.

=== Enrollment

- **Role**: JPA Entity representing the enrollment data.
- **Responsibility**: Represents the data model for enrollment in the database.

=== EnrollmentRepository

- **Role**: Repository for accessing the database.
- **Responsibility**: Provides data access functions to the `Enrollment` entity.

=== EnrollmentService

- **Role**: Service layer to handle business logic.
- **Responsibility**: Manages business operations and transactions, interacts with `EnrollmentRepository` and `UserManagementClient`.

== 3. Infrastructure Architecture

=== Deployment Architecture

The application is containerized using Docker, allowing it to be deployed on any Docker-compatible environment, including Kubernetes clusters for better scalability and management.

=== Database Architecture

The system uses an H2 in-memory database for development, with Spring Data JPA to abstract database interactions.

=== Security Architecture

Security is managed via Spring Security, providing robust authentication and authorization capabilities. HTTPS is enforced for all interactions.

=== Network Architecture

The application is designed to be deployed within a secure VPC with controlled access to external interfaces. Internal components communicate over secure channels.

== 4. System Context

=== External Systems and Their Interfaces

- **User Management System**: Accessed via REST API through `UserManagementClient`.

=== Data Flow Between Systems

Data flows from the `EnrollmentController` to `EnrollmentService`, then either to `EnrollmentRepository` for persistence or `UserManagementClient` for external data retrieval.

=== Authentication and Authorization Flows at System Level

Authentication is handled by Spring Security, which integrates with external identity providers. Authorization is managed via roles and permissions defined within the application and enforced at the controller level.

This architecture document provides a comprehensive overview of the Enrollment System, designed for scalability, maintainability, and security, suitable for understanding by architects and senior developers.

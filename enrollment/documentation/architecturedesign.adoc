=== External System Connections and Integrations

The Enrollment System interacts with the User Management System through the UserManagementClient to retrieve user information.

=== Component Interaction Overview

The EnrollmentController handles incoming HTTP requests, delegates business logic to EnrollmentService, which interacts with the EnrollmentRepository for data persistence and the UserManagementClient for user information.

=== Technology Stack and Frameworks Used

- Java Spring Boot
- Feign Client for REST API communication
- Spring Data JPA for database interaction

== Component Description

=== EnrollmentApplication

The main entry point of the application responsible for bootstrapping the Spring context.

=== EnrollmentController

A REST controller handling enrollment-related HTTP requests, delegating business logic to EnrollmentService.

=== EnrollmentService

Responsible for the business logic of enrollment, interacts with EnrollmentRepository for data access and UserManagementClient for user information.

=== EnrollmentRepository

Handles database operations related to enrollments.

=== UserManagementClient

A Feign client for communicating with the User Management System to retrieve user information.

=== Enrollment

An entity representing an enrollment record in the system.

=== UserResponseDTO

A data transfer object representing user information received from the User Management System.

== Infrastructure Architecture

=== Deployment Architecture

The Enrollment System is deployed as a Spring Boot application on a cloud-based server.

=== Database Architecture

Utilizes Spring Data JPA to interact with a relational database for storing enrollment data.

=== Security Architecture

Security measures include HTTPS for communication and role-based access control for API endpoints.

=== Network Architecture

The system communicates over HTTPS with external systems and follows a microservices architecture.

== System Context

=== External Systems and Their Interfaces

The Enrollment System interfaces with the User Management System through the UserManagementClient.

=== Data Flow Between Systems

User information flows from the User Management System to the Enrollment System for enrollment processing.

=== Authentication and Authorization Flows at System Level

The system enforces authentication for API endpoints and authorizes access based on user roles.

This architecture design document provides a high-level overview of the Enrollment System, including its components, interactions, infrastructure, and system context.

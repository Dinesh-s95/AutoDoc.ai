= Enrollment API Documentation

== Introduction

The Enrollment API provides a simple interface for managing user enrollments in a system. This API allows clients to nominate a primary user for an account. The API is designed for easy integration and robust service.

=== Authentication Requirements

Currently, the API does not require authentication. However, for production environments, it is recommended to implement an OAuth2.0 or JWT-based authentication mechanism.

=== Base URL and Versioning

The base URL for the API is `https://api.example.com/v1`. All endpoints described below are relative to this base URL. The API is versioned, and the current version is 1.

=== How to Use This Specification

This document is structured to provide all necessary details to interact with the API effectively. Use the YAML specification provided to import into tools like Swagger UI, Postman, or Insomnia for testing and integration purposes.

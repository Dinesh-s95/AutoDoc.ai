=== Common Error Codes and Their Meanings

- `400 Bad Request`: The request could not be understood by the server due to malformed syntax. The client should not repeat the request without modifications.

- `500 Internal Server Error`: The server encountered an unexpected condition which prevented it from fulfilling the request.

=== Rate Limiting Information

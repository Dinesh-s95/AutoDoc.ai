= API Documentation for Enrollment System

== Introduction

This document outlines the API specifications for the Enrollment System, which is designed to manage user enrollments and roles within a mobility service platform.

=== Authentication Requirements

Currently, the API does not require authentication. Future versions may include OAuth2 or API key-based authentication mechanisms.

=== Base URL and Versioning

The base URL for all API endpoints is `https://api.example.com/v1`. This documentation refers to version 1 of the API.

=== How to Use This Specification

This OpenAPI specification can be imported into tools like Swagger UI, Postman, or Insomnia to interact with the API. It provides a detailed description of available endpoints, request/response schemas, and other operational details.

=== Authentication Flows

Currently, no authentication is required to access the API endpoints. Future implementations will include detailed authentication flows.

=== Common Error Codes and Their Meanings

- `400 Bad Request`: This error occurs when the required parameters are not provided or are invalid. For instance, missing the `username` parameter in the `/nominatePrimary` endpoint will trigger this error.

=== Rate Limiting Information

There is no rate limiting enforced on the API at this time. Future versions may include rate limiting policies to ensure fair usage and system stability.

== Conclusion

This document provides a comprehensive guide to the Enrollment API, detailing how to interact with the system, understand potential errors, and utilize the endpoints effectively.

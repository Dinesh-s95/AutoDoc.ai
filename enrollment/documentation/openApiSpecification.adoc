= API Documentation for Enrollment System

This document provides a comprehensive guide to the Enrollment System API. It includes detailed information about how to interact with the API, the data models, and the authentication requirements.

== Introduction

The Enrollment System API allows for managing user enrollments in a system. This API is designed to facilitate operations related to user enrollment processes, such as nominating a primary user.

=== Authentication Requirements

This API does not currently implement authentication and is open for unauthenticated requests. However, in a production environment, it is highly recommended to secure all endpoints with appropriate authentication mechanisms.

=== Base URL and Versioning

The base URL for the API is `https://api.example.com/v1`. All endpoints described below are relative to this base URL.

=== How to Use This Specification

This specification is written in accordance with the OpenAPI 3.0 standards. You can import this YAML into tools like Swagger UI, Postman, or Insomnia to interact with the API or generate client code.

=== Authentication Flows

Currently, no authentication is required to access the API endpoints. It is advisable to implement at least basic authentication to protect the API in a production environment.

=== Common Error Codes

- `400 Bad Request`: This status code indicates that the request was invalid. Typical causes include missing or incorrect parameters.

=== Rate Limiting

There is no rate limiting enforced by the API at this time. However, it is recommended to implement rate limiting to prevent abuse and to ensure service availability.

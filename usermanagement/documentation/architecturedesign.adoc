= User Management System Architecture Design

This document provides a comprehensive architecture design overview of the User Management System, developed using Java Spring Boot. The system is designed to manage user identities and vehicle assignments for a mobility service.

=== External System Connections and Integrations

The User Management System integrates with the following external systems:
- **Identity Provider API**: Manages authentication and user identity verification.
- **Vehicle Management API**: Handles information related to vehicle assignments and details.

=== Component Interaction Overview

Components within the system interact primarily through service invocations:
- **UserManagementController** receives HTTP requests and delegates operations to **UserManagementService**.
- **UserManagementService** performs business logic, interacts with the database via **UserManagementRepository**, and communicates with external systems through **IdentityProviderClient** and **VehicleManagementClient**.

=== Technology Stack and Frameworks Used

- **Spring Boot**: Framework for creating stand-alone, production-grade Spring based applications.
- **Spring Data JPA**: Provides repository support for JPA data access.
- **Feign**: A declarative web service client for making REST calls.
- **H2 Database**: In-memory database for development purposes.
- **JUnit**: Framework for unit testing.

== 2. Component Description

=== UserManagementController

- **Responsibility**: Handles incoming HTTP requests related to user and vehicle management.
- **Role**: Acts as the entry point for the web layer.
- **Interactions**: Invokes services provided by **UserManagementService**.

=== UserManagementService

- **Responsibility**: Contains business logic for user onboarding and vehicle assignment.
- **Role**: Service layer component that orchestrates user data management and external API interactions.
- **Interactions**: Uses **UserManagementRepository** for database operations, **IdentityProviderClient** for user authentication, and **VehicleManagementClient** for vehicle data retrieval.

=== UserManagementRepository

- **Responsibility**: Interface for database operations related to users.
- **Role**: Data access layer that uses Spring Data JPA for CRUD operations.
- **Interactions**: Interacts directly with the database.

=== IdentityProviderClient and VehicleManagementClient

- **Responsibility**: Facilitate communication with external systems.
- **Role**: Defined as Feign clients, these components abstract the complexity of external API calls.
- **Interactions**: Called by **UserManagementService** for external data and actions.

== 3. Infrastructure Architecture

=== Deployment Architecture

The system is containerized using Docker, allowing for easy deployment and scalability. It is designed to be deployed on Kubernetes for orchestration.

=== Database Architecture

The system uses an H2 in-memory database for development, with the option to switch to a more scalable solution like PostgreSQL for production environments.

=== Security Architecture

Security is managed through Spring Security, integrating with the Identity Provider for OAuth2 authentication and authorization.

=== Network Architecture

The system is designed to be deployed within a private subnet with controlled access via load balancers. Communication with external APIs is secured using HTTPS.

== 4. System Context

=== External Systems and Their Interfaces

- **Identity Provider API**: Provides endpoints for authentication and user identity management.
- **Vehicle Management API**: Offers endpoints for vehicle data retrieval and management.

=== Data Flow Between Systems

Data flows from **UserManagementController** to **UserManagementService**, which then interacts with both the database and external APIs, handling data related to users and vehicles.

=== Authentication and Authorization Flows at System Level

Authentication is handled via OAuth2 tokens provided by the Identity Provider. The system uses these tokens to authorize operations and manage access control.

This document provides a high-level overview of the architecture and components of the User Management System, designed for scalability, security, and efficient data management.

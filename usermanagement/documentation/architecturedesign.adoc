=== External System Connections and Integrations

The User Management System integrates with the following external systems:
- **Identity Provider System**: For user authentication and authorization.
- **Vehicle Management System**: For vehicle data retrieval and management.

=== Component Interaction Overview

The `UserManagementController` receives HTTP requests and interacts with the `UserManagementService` to process business logic. The service layer communicates with external systems through `IdentityProviderClient` and `VehicleManagementClient` and manages user data via the `UserManagementRepository`.

=== Technology Stack and Frameworks Used

- **Spring Boot**: Framework for creating stand-alone, production-grade Spring based applications.
- **Spring Data JPA**: For database operations.
- **Feign Client**: For RESTful communication with external services.
- **H2 Database**: In-memory database for development.
- **JUnit**: For unit testing.

== 2. Component Description

=== UserManagementApplication

This is the entry point of the application, annotated with `@SpringBootApplication`. It bootstraps the application using Spring Boot's auto-configuration.

=== UserManagementController

A REST controller that handles all user-related operations such as user onboarding and vehicle assignment. It is annotated with `@RestController` and uses `@Autowired` to inject `UserManagementService`.

=== UserManagementService

The service layer that contains business logic. It interacts with `IdentityProviderClient` and `VehicleManagementClient` for external operations and `UserManagementRepository` for data persistence.

=== UserManagementRepository

This component interacts with the database using Spring Data JPA. It is responsible for all CRUD operations related to `MobilityUser`.

=== MobilityUser

An entity representing a user in the system. It is annotated with `@Entity` and mapped to a database table through `@Table`.

=== IdentityProviderClient and VehicleManagementClient

These are Feign clients used to communicate with external systems. They are annotated with `@FeignClient` and provide an abstraction over HTTP client methods.

== 3. Infrastructure Architecture

=== Deployment Architecture

The application is containerized using Docker, allowing it to be deployed on any Docker-compatible environment, including Kubernetes clusters for scaling purposes.

=== Database Architecture

The system uses an H2 in-memory database for development, with Spring Data JPA for ORM. For production, a transition to a more robust SQL database like PostgreSQL is recommended.

=== Security Architecture

Security is managed via Spring Security, integrating with OAuth2 for secure token-based user authentication.

=== Network Architecture

The application is designed to be deployed within a secure VPC, with firewalls configured to allow only HTTPS traffic and necessary internal communication.

== 4. System Context

=== External Systems and Their Interfaces

- **Identity Provider System**: Provides RESTful APIs for authentication and user management, accessed via `IdentityProviderClient`.
- **Vehicle Management System**: Offers APIs for vehicle data, accessed through `VehicleManagementClient`.

=== Data Flow Between Systems

1. User data flows from `UserManagementController` to `UserManagementService`.
2. `UserManagementService` communicates with external systems for authentication and vehicle management.
3. Responses are aggregated and persisted via `UserManagementRepository`.

=== Authentication and Authorization Flows at System Level

Authentication is handled by the Identity Provider, which issues JWT tokens that are used for subsequent requests to the system, ensuring that users are authenticated and authorized appropriately.

This architecture document provides a comprehensive overview of the User Management System, designed for scalability, security, and effective integration with external systems.

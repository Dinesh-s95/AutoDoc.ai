=== External System Connections and Integrations

The User Management System integrates with an Identity Provider and a Vehicle Management System using Feign Clients.

=== Component Interaction Overview

The UserManagementController interacts with the UserManagementService, which further interacts with the UserManagementRepository, IdentityProviderClient, VehicleManagementClient, and MobilityUser.

=== Technology Stack and Frameworks Used

- Java Spring Boot
- Feign Clients for REST API communication
- JPA for entity management
- Spring Security for authentication and authorization

== Component Description

=== UserManagementController

The UserManagementController is responsible for handling HTTP requests related to user management operations. It communicates with the UserManagementService to perform user-related actions.

=== UserManagementService

The UserManagementService contains business logic for user management operations. It interacts with the UserManagementRepository for data persistence, IdentityProviderClient for authentication, and VehicleManagementClient for vehicle-related operations.

=== UserManagementRepository

The UserManagementRepository is responsible for database interactions related to user management entities.

=== IdentityProviderClient

The IdentityProviderClient is a Feign Client used to communicate with the external Identity Provider for user authentication.

=== VehicleManagementClient

The VehicleManagementClient is a Feign Client used to communicate with the external Vehicle Management System for vehicle-related operations.

=== MobilityUser

The MobilityUser entity represents a user in the system and is managed by the UserManagementService.

=== External Dependencies and Integrations

- Identity Provider for user authentication
- Vehicle Management System for vehicle operations

== Infrastructure Architecture

=== Deployment Architecture

The User Management System is deployed as a Java Spring Boot application on a cloud-based platform.

=== Database Architecture

The system uses JPA for entity management and interacts with a relational database for data storage.

=== Security Architecture

Spring Security is used for authentication and authorization of users accessing the system.

=== Network Architecture

The system communicates with external systems over secure HTTP connections.

== System Context

=== External Systems and Their Interfaces

- Identity Provider: Provides user authentication services.
- Vehicle Management System: Manages vehicle-related operations.

=== Data Flow Between Systems

- UserManagementService interacts with IdentityProviderClient and VehicleManagementClient to perform user and vehicle operations.

=== Authentication and Authorization Flows at System Level

- Users are authenticated by the Identity Provider before accessing the User Management System.
- Spring Security enforces authorization rules within the User Management System.

This document provides a high-level overview of the architecture design of the User Management System, detailing its components, interactions, external integrations, and infrastructure setup.

= User Management Service Architecture Design

This document provides a comprehensive architecture design overview of the User Management Service, a Java Spring Boot application designed to handle user and vehicle management tasks. The architecture is designed to be scalable, secure, and maintainable, with clear separation of concerns and integration with external systems.

=== External System Connections and Integrations

- **Identity Provider API**: Integrated via `IdentityProviderClient`, used for authenticating and managing user credentials.
- **Vehicle Management API**: Integrated via `VehicleManagementClient`, used for managing vehicle data associated with users.

=== Component Interaction Overview

- **UserManagementController** receives HTTP requests and delegates business operations to **UserManagementService**.
- **UserManagementService** performs the business logic, interacts with the database via **UserManagementRepository**, and communicates with external systems through **IdentityProviderClient** and **VehicleManagementClient**.

=== Technology Stack and Frameworks Used

- **Spring Boot**: Framework for creating stand-alone, production-grade Spring based Applications.
- **Spring Data JPA**: For database operations.
- **Spring Cloud OpenFeign**: For REST client building.
- **MySQL**: Database for storing user and vehicle data.
- **JUnit**: For unit testing.

== 2. Component Description

=== UserManagementController

- **Responsibility**: Handles incoming HTTP requests, validates input, and delegates business processing to the service layer.
- **Role**: Acts as the entry point for the user management operations like user onboarding and vehicle assignment.
- **Interactions**: Directly interacts with `UserManagementService`.

=== UserManagementService

- **Responsibility**: Contains core business logic for user management operations.
- **Role**: Manages user data interactions and delegates tasks to external systems via clients.
- **Interactions**: Uses `UserManagementRepository` for database operations, `IdentityProviderClient` for user authentication, and `VehicleManagementClient` for vehicle management.

=== UserManagementRepository

- **Responsibility**: Interface for database operations, abstracting the data layer.
- **Role**: Manages CRUD operations for `MobilityUser` entities.
- **Interactions**: Interacts with the MySQL database through Spring Data JPA.

=== IdentityProviderClient and VehicleManagementClient

- **Responsibility**: Facilitate communication with external systems.
- **Role**: Proxy for external API calls to Identity Provider and Vehicle Management systems.
- **Interactions**: Send and receive data to/from external APIs.

== 3. Infrastructure Architecture

=== Deployment Architecture

- **Deployment**: Containerized Spring Boot application deployed on Kubernetes for easy scaling and management.
- **CI/CD**: Jenkins pipelines for automated testing and deployment.

=== Database Architecture

- **Database**: MySQL, with tables designed to support user and vehicle management functionalities.
- **Access**: Accessed via Spring Data JPA integrated in `UserManagementRepository`.

=== Security Architecture

- **Authentication**: Integrated with an external Identity Provider for OAuth2 authentication.
- **Authorization**: Role-based access control within the application to differentiate user capabilities.

=== Network Architecture

- **Load Balancer**: Distributes incoming traffic to improve responsiveness and availability.
- **Firewall**: Protects against unauthorized access.

== 4. System Context

=== External Systems and Their Interfaces

- **Identity Provider API**: Provides endpoints for user authentication and credential management.
- **Vehicle Management API**: Offers endpoints for vehicle data retrieval and management.

=== Data Flow Between Systems

=== Authentication and Authorization Flows at System Level

- **Authentication**: Users authenticate via the Identity Provider API, which validates credentials and returns security tokens.
- **Authorization**: The application uses these tokens to authorize user actions based on assigned roles and permissions.

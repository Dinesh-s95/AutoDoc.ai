### Explanation:
- **Overview Section**: Provides basic information about the API including title, version, and a brief description.
- **Paths**: Defined for each endpoint derived from the methods in the `UserManagementController`. Each path includes method operations (POST in this case), a summary, description, operation ID, request body schema, example payloads, and possible responses.
- **Components**: Defines JSON schemas for the request bodies (`UserCredentials` and `VehicleAssignment`) used in the endpoints.
- **Security**: Includes a JWT-based security scheme for the API, assuming JWT is used for authentication as per the initial requirements.

This specification should be validatable in tools like Swagger Editor and can be directly used in API Gateways or imported into tools like Postman for testing.

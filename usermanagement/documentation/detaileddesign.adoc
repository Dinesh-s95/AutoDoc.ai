== Class-by-Class Analysis

=== UsermanagementApplication

The `UsermanagementApplication` class is the main entry point for the Spring Boot application. It contains the `main` method which starts the Spring Boot application. The class is annotated with `@EnableFeignClients` and `@SpringBootApplication` for enabling Feign clients and marking it as a Spring Boot application.

Design Patterns Used: N/A

=== IdentityProviderClient

The `IdentityProviderClient` class is a Feign client used to communicate with an external identity provider service. It is annotated with `@FeignClient`, `@PostMapping`, and `@RequestBody` to specify the Feign client and HTTP method mappings.

Design Patterns Used: N/A

=== VehicleManagementClient

The `VehicleManagementClient` class is a Feign client used to interact with a vehicle management service. It is annotated with `@FeignClient`, `@GetMapping`, and `@RequestParam` for defining Feign client and HTTP method mappings.

Design Patterns Used: N/A

=== UserManagementController

The `UserManagementController` class is a REST controller responsible for handling user management related endpoints. It contains methods like `assignVehicle` and `onboardUser` annotated with `@PostMapping`, `@RequestMapping`, and `@RequestParam` for mapping HTTP requests to methods.

Design Patterns Used: N/A

=== MobilityUser

The `MobilityUser` class represents a user entity with attributes like `id`, `mobilityUserId`, `role`, `username`, and `vin`. It is annotated with `@Entity`, `@GeneratedValue`, `@Getter`, `@Id`, `@Setter`, and `@Table` to define it as an entity with JPA annotations.

Design Patterns Used: N/A

=== UserManagementRepository

The `UserManagementRepository` class is a Spring Data repository interface for managing `MobilityUser` entities. It contains methods for CRUD operations on the `MobilityUser` entity.

Design Patterns Used: N/A

=== UserManagementService

The `UserManagementService` class contains business logic for user management operations. It has methods like `getUserByUsername`, `onboardUser`, and `assignVehicleToUser` to interact with the repository and external services. It is annotated with `@Autowired` and `@Service`.

Design Patterns Used: N/A

=== UsermanagementApplicationTests

The `UsermanagementApplicationTests` class contains test cases for the `UsermanagementApplication` class. It is annotated with `@SpringBootTest` and `@Test` for running Spring Boot tests.

== Detailed Component Interactions

The User Management module follows a typical Controller-Service-Repository architecture for handling user-related operations.

- **Controller-Service Interaction**:
  - The `UserManagementController` receives HTTP requests and delegates the business logic to the `UserManagementService`.
  - The `UserManagementService` interacts with external services like `IdentityProviderClient` and `VehicleManagementClient` to fulfill user management operations.

- **Data Flow Through Layers**:
  - Data flows from the controller to the service layer for processing and then to the repository for persistence.
  - External service interactions are handled by the service layer.

- **Exception Propagation**:
  - Exceptions thrown at any layer are caught and handled appropriately.
  - For example, if a user is not found in the repository, an error response is propagated back to the controller.

- **Transaction Boundaries**:
  - Transaction boundaries are managed by the underlying Spring framework, ensuring data consistency during database operations.

This design ensures separation of concerns, modularity, and scalability in the user management module.

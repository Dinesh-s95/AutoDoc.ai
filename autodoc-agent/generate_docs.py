1. This Java class summary:

2. All other classes in the microservice:

3. The architecture diagram in PlantUML (showing relationships):

Explain:
- What this class is responsible for in this microservice
- How it's connected to other classes (based on method calls, fields, layers, etc.)
- What services or layers depend on it
- If it plays any special role (e.g., Entity, Service, AuthProvider, Controller, Utility, Security)

Do NOT repeat basic Java explanations like "this is a class with no fields"
Do NOT describe annotations or methods separately if not relevant
Tag this block with a unique ID like _(AD_<ClassName>) for traceability

# You are a software architect. Based on the following list of Java classes, their annotations, method names, and fields, generate a clean, layered, and high-level architecture diagram using PlantUML code.
#
# **Objective:**
# Produce PlantUML code that clearly represents the application's architecture and responsibilities. Group the classes logically into layers such as:
# - Controllers (e.g., annotated with @RestController)
# - Services (e.g., annotated with @Service)
# - Repositories (e.g., annotated with @Repository)
# - Configuration/Security
# - Domain/Entities (e.g., annotated with @Entity)
# - Filters or Components (e.g., @Component)
# - Main Application class (e.g., @SpringBootApplication)
#
# **Guidelines for the PlantUML diagram:**
# - Clearly separate these groups using `package` blocks.
# - Use only key method signatures or class roles ‚Äî do not list all methods unless relevant.
# - Minimize "mesh" style arrows. Prefer unidirectional dependencies (top-down: Controller ‚Üí Service ‚Üí Repository).
# - Use appropriate stereotypes or colors to indicate class roles (e.g., @Service, @Entity, etc.).
# - Include dependencies (arrows) only where there are real interactions (e.g., UserService ‚Üí UserRepository).
# - Name relationships meaningfully when needed.
# - Align the layout for readability (top to bottom or left to right flow).
# - Annotate or comment classes as needed for clarity.

=== External System Connections and Integrations

The Vehicle Management System interacts with external systems for data exchange and validation purposes.

=== Component Interaction Overview

The Vehicle Management System consists of the following components:
- VehicleController: Handles incoming HTTP requests related to vehicle management.
- VehicleRepository: Manages the persistence of vehicle data.
- Vehicle: Represents the entity for vehicle details.

=== Technology Stack and Frameworks Used

The Vehicle Management System is built using:
- Java Spring Boot
- Hibernate for ORM
- Spring Data JPA for data access
- Spring MVC for RESTful services

== Component Description

=== VehicleController

The VehicleController component is responsible for handling incoming HTTP requests related to vehicle management. It interacts with the VehicleRepository to perform CRUD operations on vehicle entities. The VehicleController exposes REST endpoints for registering and verifying vehicles.

=== VehicleRepository

The VehicleRepository component is responsible for managing the persistence of vehicle data. It interacts with the database to store and retrieve vehicle information. The VehicleRepository uses Spring Data JPA for data access.

=== Vehicle

The Vehicle component represents the entity for vehicle details. It contains attributes such as brand, country, device, model, SOP, and VIN. The Vehicle entity is mapped to a database table for storage.

=== How Components Interact with Each Other

- VehicleController interacts with VehicleRepository to perform CRUD operations on vehicle entities.
- VehicleRepository interacts with the database to store and retrieve vehicle data.

=== External Dependencies and Integrations

The Vehicle Management System may integrate with external systems for validation and data exchange purposes.

== Infrastructure Architecture

=== Deployment Architecture

The Vehicle Management System is deployed as a Java Spring Boot application on a cloud-based server.

=== Database Architecture

The system uses a relational database to store vehicle data. The database schema is designed to accommodate the Vehicle entity attributes.

=== Security Architecture

Security measures such as HTTPS, authentication, and authorization mechanisms are implemented to secure the system from unauthorized access.

=== Network Architecture

The system communicates over HTTP/HTTPS protocols for client-server interactions.

== System Context

=== External Systems and Their Interfaces

The Vehicle Management System interfaces with external systems for data validation and exchange. These external systems may include third-party APIs or services.

=== Data Flow Between Systems

Data flows between the Vehicle Management System and external systems for validation and integration purposes.

=== Authentication and Authorization Flows at System Level

The system implements authentication and authorization mechanisms to control access to resources and ensure data security.

This concludes the architecture design documentation for the Vehicle Management System.

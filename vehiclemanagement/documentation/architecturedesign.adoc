= Vehicle Management System Architecture Design

This document provides a comprehensive architecture design for the Vehicle Management System, focusing on the service architecture, component descriptions, infrastructure architecture, and system context.

=== External System Connections and Integrations

The Vehicle Management System integrates with an external vehicle information system for data verification and enrichment. This connection is managed through the `VehicleService` component, which communicates with external APIs.

=== Component Interaction Overview

- **VehiclemanagementApplication**: Initializes the Spring Boot application.
- **VehicleController**: Handles HTTP requests and communicates with `VehicleService` to process data.
- **VehicleService**: Provides business logic and interacts with `VehicleRepository` and external systems.
- **VehicleRepository**: Manages data persistence in the Vehicle Database.

=== Technology Stack and Frameworks Used

- **Spring Boot**: Framework for creating stand-alone, production-grade Spring based applications.
- **Spring Data JPA**: Provides repository support for JPA data access.
- **H2 Database**: In-memory database for development and testing.
- **Maven**: Dependency management and project lifecycle management.

== 2. Component Description

=== VehiclemanagementApplication

Responsible for bootstrapping the application using Spring Boot's auto-configuration.

=== VehicleController

Handles incoming HTTP requests and delegates operations to the `VehicleService`. It uses annotations like `@RestController` and `@RequestMapping` to map requests.

=== VehicleService

Contains business logic for registering and verifying vehicles. It communicates with `VehicleRepository` for data persistence and interacts with external systems for data verification.

=== VehicleRepository

Interface for the data access layer, using Spring Data JPA to interact with the database.

=== External Dependencies and Integrations

- **External Vehicle Information System**: Used for validating and enriching vehicle data during registration.

== 3. Infrastructure Architecture

=== Deployment Architecture

The application is containerized using Docker, allowing it to be deployed on any Docker-compatible environment, including Kubernetes clusters for scaling purposes.

=== Database Architecture

The system uses an H2 in-memory database for development, with the option to switch to a more robust solution like PostgreSQL for production environments.

=== Security Architecture

Implements basic authentication and authorization using Spring Security. Data is secured both in transit and at rest using SSL and database encryption.

=== Network Architecture

The application is designed to be deployed within a private subnet with controlled access via load balancers.

== 4. System Context

=== External Systems and Their Interfaces

- **External Vehicle Information System**: Provides RESTful APIs for vehicle data verification and enrichment.

=== Data Flow Between Systems

Data flows from the `VehicleController` to `VehicleService`, then either to `VehicleRepository` for persistence or to external systems for additional processing.

=== Authentication and Authorization Flows at System Level

Authentication is managed by Spring Security, which integrates with the system's user database to provide user validation and token generation.

This architecture document outlines the structure and design of the Vehicle Management System, providing a clear overview for architects and senior developers involved in the project.

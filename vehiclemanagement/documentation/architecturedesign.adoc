=== External System Connections and Integrations

The Vehicle Management System interacts with external systems for data exchange and integration purposes. These external systems could include vehicle registration databases, authentication services, and third-party APIs.

=== Component Interaction Overview

The Vehicle Management System consists of the following main components:
- VehicleController: Handles incoming HTTP requests related to vehicle management.
- VehicleRepository: Manages the persistence and retrieval of vehicle data.
- Vehicle: Represents the entity for vehicle information storage.

The VehicleController interacts with the VehicleRepository to perform CRUD operations on the Vehicle entity. The VehicleRepository communicates with the database for data storage and retrieval.

=== Technology Stack and Frameworks Used

The Vehicle Management System is built using the following technologies and frameworks:
- Java Spring Boot: Provides the foundation for building the application.
- Hibernate: Manages the object-relational mapping for database interactions.
- RESTful APIs: Used for communication between components.
- PlantUML: Used for creating architectural diagrams.

== Component Description

=== VehicleController

The VehicleController component is responsible for handling incoming HTTP requests related to vehicle management. It contains endpoints for registering vehicles and verifying vehicle registrations.

Interaction:
- Communicates with the VehicleRepository to perform database operations.
- Validates incoming requests using annotations like @Validated.

Dependencies:
- Depends on the VehicleRepository for database operations.

=== VehicleRepository

The VehicleRepository component is responsible for managing the persistence and retrieval of vehicle data. It interacts with the database to store and retrieve vehicle information.

Interaction:
- Interacts with the database using Hibernate for CRUD operations.

Dependencies:
- No external dependencies.

=== Vehicle

The Vehicle component represents the entity for storing vehicle information. It contains attributes like brand, country, device, model, SOP, and VIN.

Interaction:
- Used by the VehicleRepository for database operations.

Dependencies:
- No external dependencies.

== Infrastructure Architecture

=== Deployment Architecture

The Vehicle Management System is deployed as a Spring Boot application on a cloud-based platform like AWS or Azure. It follows a microservices architecture for scalability and flexibility.

=== Database Architecture

The system uses a relational database (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL) to store vehicle information. Hibernate ORM is used for object-relational mapping to interact with the database.

=== Security Architecture

The system implements security measures such as HTTPS for secure communication, role-based access control for authorization, and input validation to prevent injection attacks.

=== Network Architecture

The system is designed to operate in a distributed network environment. It uses RESTful APIs for communication between components and follows industry-standard networking protocols for data exchange.

== System Context

=== External Systems and Their Interfaces

The Vehicle Management System interacts with external systems such as vehicle registration databases, authentication services, and third-party APIs. These interactions occur through RESTful APIs and data exchange protocols.

=== Data Flow Between Systems

Data flows between the Vehicle Management System and external systems for vehicle registration, verification, and information retrieval. The system ensures data integrity and consistency during these interactions.

=== Authentication and Authorization Flows at System Level

The system implements authentication mechanisms like OAuth2 for user authentication and authorization. Role-based access control is used to restrict access to sensitive operations and data within the system.

== Conclusion

The Vehicle Management System architecture is designed to be scalable, secure, and efficient. By leveraging Java Spring Boot and related frameworks, the system provides a robust platform for managing vehicle information effectively.

This document provides an overview of the system architecture, component interactions, infrastructure setup, and external system integrations, making it suitable for architects and senior developers to understand the overall design of the Vehicle Management System.

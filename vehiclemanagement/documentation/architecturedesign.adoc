= Vehicle Management System Architecture Design

This document provides a comprehensive architecture design for the Vehicle Management System developed using Java Spring Boot. It outlines the system's service architecture, component descriptions, infrastructure, and system context.

=== External System Connections and Integrations

The Vehicle Management System integrates with an **External Vehicle Registration System** for validating vehicle registrations. This integration is handled through RESTful services exposed by the external system.

=== Component Interaction Overview

- **Vehicle Controller** communicates with **Vehicle Service** for processing business logic.
- **Vehicle Service** interacts with **Vehicle Repository** for data persistence.
- **Vehicle Repository** manages data in the **Vehicle Database**.
- External APIs are consumed by the **Vehicle Controller** for additional data verification.

=== Technology Stack and Frameworks Used

- **Spring Boot**: Framework for creating stand-alone, production-grade Spring based applications.
- **Spring Data JPA**: For database operations.
- **Spring Web MVC**: For REST controllers.
- **H2 Database**: In-memory database for development.
- **PostgreSQL**: Production database.
- **JUnit**: For unit testing.
- **Maven**: Dependency management and build tool.

== 2. Component Description

=== Vehicle Entity

- **Responsibility**: Represents the vehicle data model.
- **Role**: Managed by JPA for data persistence.
- **Interaction**: Accessed by the Vehicle Repository to perform CRUD operations.

=== Vehicle Controller

- **Responsibility**: Handles HTTP requests and responses.
- **Role**: Acts as the system's RESTful service endpoint.
- **Interaction**: Uses Vehicle Service to process business logic and interacts with external systems.

=== Vehicle Service

- **Responsibility**: Contains business logic.
- **Role**: Service layer that acts as a bridge between the controller and repository.
- **Interaction**: Calls Vehicle Repository for data operations.

=== Vehicle Repository

- **Responsibility**: Interface for database operations.
- **Role**: Spring Data JPA repository that abstracts CRUD operations.
- **Interaction**: Directly manages the Vehicle Entity in the database.

=== External Dependencies and Integrations

- **External Vehicle Registration System**: For validating vehicle registrations through RESTful services.

== 3. Infrastructure Architecture

=== Deployment Architecture

- **Application Server**: Spring Boot application packaged as a JAR running on a Java virtual machine.
- **Load Balancer**: Distributes incoming traffic to multiple application instances for high availability.

=== Database Architecture

- **Development**: Uses H2 in-memory database for rapid prototyping.
- **Production**: PostgreSQL for robust, scalable data storage.

=== Security Architecture

- **Spring Security**: For authentication and authorization.
- **HTTPS**: Encrypts HTTP requests and responses.
- **JWT**: Secures REST APIs by ensuring that only valid requests are processed.

=== Network Architecture

- **Internal Network**: Communication between application components.
- **External Access**: Through defined API gateways with rate limiting and IP whitelisting.

== 4. System Context

=== External Systems and Their Interfaces

- **External Vehicle Registration System**: Provides RESTful APIs for vehicle registration verification.

=== Data Flow Between Systems

- Data flows from the Vehicle Controller to the external system for registration verification and back to the controller.

=== Authentication and Authorization Flows at System Level

- **JWT-based Authentication**: Users authenticate via a login endpoint that issues a JWT upon successful authentication.
- **Role-based Authorization**: Ensures users can only access resources according to their roles.

This architecture document provides a blueprint for understanding, maintaining, and extending the Vehicle Management System.

== Class-by-Class Analysis

=== Vehicle

Purpose:
- Represents a vehicle entity with attributes like brand, country, device, model, sop, and vin.
- Annotated with @Entity to mark it as a JPA entity.
- Contains getters and setters for the attributes.

Methods:
- `getSop()`: Returns the start of production date.
- `getBrand()`: Returns the brand of the vehicle.
- `getCountry()`: Returns the country of the vehicle.
- `getDevice()`: Returns the device of the vehicle.
- `getModel()`: Returns the model of the vehicle.
- `getVin()`: Returns the vehicle identification number.
- `setBrand(String brand)`: Sets the brand of the vehicle.
- `setCountry(String country)`: Sets the country of the vehicle.
- `setDevice(String device)`: Sets the device of the vehicle.
- `setModel(String model)`: Sets the model of the vehicle.
- `setSop(LocalDate sop)`: Sets the start of production date.
- `setVin(String vin)`: Sets the vehicle identification number.

Design Patterns:
- Entity pattern for database persistence.

=== VehiclemanagementApplication

Purpose:
- Main application class annotated with @SpringBootApplication.

Methods:
- `main(String[] args)`: Entry point for the Spring Boot application.

=== VehicleController

Purpose:
- REST controller for handling vehicle-related endpoints.
- Annotated with @RestController to mark it as a controller.
- Contains methods for registering a vehicle and verifying registration.

Methods:
- `registerVehicle(Vehicle vehicle)`: Registers a new vehicle.
- `verifyRegistration(String vin, String brand, String country)`: Verifies the registration details.

Fields:
- `vehicleRepository`: Instance of VehicleRepository for data access.

Design Patterns:
- Controller pattern for handling HTTP requests.

=== VehicleRepository

Purpose:
- Repository interface for interacting with the database.
- Annotated with @Repository for Spring Data JPA.

=== VehiclemanagementApplicationTests

Purpose:
- Test class for testing the application.
- Annotated with @SpringBootTest and @Test for Spring Boot testing.

== Detailed Component Interactions

- Controller-Service-Repository interactions: VehicleController interacts with VehicleRepository for data operations.
- Data flow through layers: HTTP requests flow from the controller to the service layer and then to the repository for data access.
- Exception propagation: Exceptions are handled at each layer and propagated to the appropriate handler.
- Transaction boundaries: Transactions are managed by Spring's transaction management for database operations.

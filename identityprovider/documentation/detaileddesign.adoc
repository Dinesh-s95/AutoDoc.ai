== Class-by-Class Analysis

=== IdentityproviderApplication

This class represents the main entry point of the Spring Boot application. It is annotated with @SpringBootApplication. The main method initializes and starts the Spring application context.

Design Patterns Used: N/A

=== JwtAuthFilter

This class is a filter responsible for JWT authentication. It extends OncePerRequestFilter and overrides the doFilterInternal method to intercept and process JWT tokens.

Design Patterns Used: Chain of Responsibility

=== SecurityConfig

This class is a configuration class for Spring Security. It is annotated with @Configuration and @EnableWebSecurity. It provides configurations for authenticationManager, authenticationProvider, and securityFilterChain.

Design Patterns Used: N/A

=== UserController

This class is a REST controller handling user-related operations. It is annotated with @RestController. It provides endpoints for user login, registration, and greetings.

Design Patterns Used: N/A

=== AuthRequest

This class represents the authentication request payload. It contains fields for username and password.

Design Patterns Used: N/A

=== AuthResponse

This class represents the authentication response payload.

Design Patterns Used: N/A

=== UserPrincipal

This class represents the authenticated user principal. It implements UserDetails and contains methods for user details and authorities.

== Detailed Component Interactions

The application follows a typical layered architecture with interactions between Controller, Service, and Repository layers. Here is a brief overview of the component interactions:

- UserController interacts with UserService for user-related operations.
- UserService interacts with UserRepository for database operations.
- JwtAuthFilter interacts with JWTService for JWT token handling.
- SecurityConfig provides configurations for authentication and security filters.
- UserPrincipal represents the authenticated user details.
- JWTService handles JWT token generation, validation, and extraction.
- UserRepository is the Spring Data repository for User entities.

Data flows from the Controller layer to the Service layer and then to the Repository layer. Exception handling is centralized using ExceptionHandler classes to handle and propagate exceptions across layers. Transaction boundaries are managed by Spring's transaction management.

This design ensures separation of concerns, modularity, and maintainability of the application.

= Identity Provider Service Architecture Documentation

This document provides a comprehensive architecture design for the Identity Provider Service, a Java Spring Boot application. The design covers various aspects including service architecture, component description, infrastructure architecture, and system context.

== 1. Service Architecture Overview

=== External System Connections and Integrations

The Identity Provider Service integrates with the following external systems:
- **Email System**: For sending out notification and welcome emails.
- **Audit System**: For logging security and operational events.

=== Component Interaction Overview

Components within the Identity Provider Service interact primarily through Spring-managed beans. `UserController` manages all user-related operations and communicates with `UserService` for business logic, which in turn interacts with `UserRepository` for data persistence.

=== Technology Stack and Frameworks Used

- **Java**: Programming language.
- **Spring Boot**: Application framework.
- **Spring Security**: For authentication and authorization.
- **JWT**: For token management.
- **Hibernate**: ORM for database interaction.
- **MySQL**: Database for storing user and authentication data.
- **Maven**: Dependency management and build tool.

== 2. Component Description

=== IdentityproviderApplication

This is the entry point of the Spring Boot application. It initializes the Spring context and sets up the application.

=== JwtAuthFilter

A filter that intercepts requests to perform JWT-based authentication.

=== SecurityConfig

Configures security aspects of the application, such as authentication managers and security filters.

=== UserController

Exposes REST endpoints for user management, including login, registration, and token refresh operations.

=== UserService

Handles business logic related to user management. It interacts with `UserRepository` for data persistence and uses `EmailService` and `AuditService` for sending emails and logging, respectively.

=== JWTService

Manages JWT token creation, validation, and invalidation. It interacts with `AuditService` for logging token-related activities.

=== UserRepository, User, Role, Token, Client

These components are involved in data handling and persistence. `UserRepository` is a Spring Data JPA repository used for database operations related to the `User` entity.

== 3. Infrastructure Architecture

=== Deployment Architecture

The application is containerized using Docker, allowing it to be deployed on any Docker-compatible environment, including Kubernetes clusters for better scalability and management.

=== Database Architecture

The application uses MySQL as its relational database, with tables for users, roles, tokens, and clients. Hibernate ORM is used for database interaction.

=== Security Architecture

Security is enforced using Spring Security with JWT for stateless authentication. HTTPS is enforced for all communications.

=== Network Architecture

The application is deployed within a private subnet with controlled access via load balancers. Only HTTPS traffic is permitted, ensuring encrypted data transfers.

== 4. System Context

=== External Systems and Their Interfaces

- **Email System**: Interfaced via SMTP for sending emails.
- **Audit System**: REST API for sending audit logs.

=== Data Flow Between Systems

User data flows from the UserController to UserService and then to UserRepository for persistence. JWTService generates tokens that are sent back to clients and also used for user authentication.

=== Authentication and Authorization Flows at System Level

Authentication is handled via JWT tokens. Users submit credentials to receive a token, which is then used for subsequent requests. Authorization is role-based, managed by Spring Security configurations.

This architecture document provides a detailed overview of the Identity Provider Service, ensuring that architects and senior developers can understand and work with the system effectively.

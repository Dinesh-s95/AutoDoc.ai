= Identity Provider System Architecture Design

The Identity Provider (IDP) system is designed to manage user authentication and authorization through a secure and scalable architecture. This document outlines the system's architecture, detailing the service architecture, component interactions, infrastructure, and system context.

=== External System Connections and Integrations

The IDP system integrates with external systems primarily for notification services. It uses SMTP servers for sending emails and potentially integrates with other APIs for push notifications.

=== Component Interaction Overview

The system is structured around the Spring Boot framework, utilizing Spring Security for authentication mechanisms. The `UserController` handles all user-related operations and interacts with `UserService` for business logic, which in turn communicates with `UserRepository` for data persistence.

=== Technology Stack and Frameworks Used

- **Framework**: Spring Boot, Spring Security
- **Programming Language**: Java
- **Database**: SQL-based database (e.g., PostgreSQL)
- **Other**: JWT for token management, Hibernate ORM for database interactions, Spring Data JPA

== 2. Component Description

=== IdentityproviderApplication

This is the entry point of the Spring Boot application. It initializes the application context and sets up the entire application.

=== JwtAuthFilter

A filter that intercepts requests to validate JWT tokens for secure endpoints.

=== SecurityConfig

Configures authentication and authorization mechanisms, including JWT filters and security rules.

=== UserController

Handles all HTTP requests related to user operations such as login, registration, and token refresh.

=== UserService

Contains business logic for user management, including registration and loading user details.

=== UserRepository

Interface for database operations related to users, utilizing Spring Data JPA.

=== JWTService

Manages JWT token creation, validation, and invalidation.

=== EmailService and NotificationService

Manages sending emails and other notifications to users.

=== AuditService

Responsible for logging security-related events within the application.

== 3. Infrastructure Architecture

=== Deployment Architecture

The application is containerized using Docker, allowing for easy deployment to any environment including cloud platforms like AWS, Azure, or GCP.

=== Database Architecture

Utilizes a relational database management system (RDBMS) for storing user data, roles, tokens, and client information. The database schema is managed through Hibernate ORM with Spring Data JPA integration.

=== Security Architecture

Implements JWT for secure stateless authentication. Uses Spring Security for configuring HTTP session, CSRF protection, and CORS policies.

=== Network Architecture

Deployed within a VPC for isolation with controlled access via security groups. HTTPS is enforced for all communications.

== 4. System Context

=== External Systems and Their Interfaces

The system interacts with SMTP servers for sending emails and can integrate with other external notification systems via REST APIs.

=== Data Flow Between Systems

User credentials and tokens are exchanged between the client applications and the IDP system. Email notifications are sent through external SMTP services.

=== Authentication and Authorization Flows at System Level

Authentication is performed using username and password, followed by JWT token issuance. Authorization is managed via roles and permissions encoded within the JWT.

=== External System Connections and Integrations

The Identity Provider System interacts with external systems for authentication and authorization services.

=== Component Interaction Overview

The components interact as follows:
- UserController communicates with UserService and JWTService.
- UserService interacts with UserRepository for user data operations.
- JWTService manages token generation and validation.
- JwtAuthFilter filters and authenticates requests.

=== Technology Stack and Frameworks Used

- Java Spring Boot
- Spring Security
- Spring Data JPA
- Lombok
- BCryptPasswordEncoder

== Component Description

=== UserController

The UserController is responsible for handling user-related HTTP requests. It interacts with UserService and JWTService for user operations.

=== UserService

The UserService component manages user-related business logic and interacts with the UserRepository for data persistence.

=== JwtAuthFilter

JwtAuthFilter is responsible for filtering and authenticating incoming requests using JWT tokens. It collaborates with UserService for user authentication.

=== SecurityConfig

SecurityConfig configures security settings for the application, including authentication providers and filters.

=== UserRepository

UserRepository provides data access methods for user entities using Spring Data JPA.

=== JWTService

JWTService handles JWT token generation, validation, and extraction of user details from tokens.

== Infrastructure Architecture

=== Deployment Architecture

The Identity Provider System is deployed as a Spring Boot application on a cloud platform like AWS or Azure.

=== Database Architecture

The system uses Spring Data JPA with an underlying relational database for user data storage.

=== Security Architecture

Security is implemented using Spring Security with JWT tokens for authentication and authorization.

=== Network Architecture

The system communicates over HTTP protocols for client-server interactions.

== System Context

=== External Systems and Interfaces

The Identity Provider System interacts with external systems for user authentication and authorization services.

=== Data Flow Between Systems

User authentication requests flow from external systems to the Identity Provider System for validation and token generation.

=== Authentication and Authorization Flows at System Level

The system follows a JWT-based authentication flow where users authenticate with credentials to receive tokens for accessing protected resources.

This document provides an overview of the architecture design for the Identity Provider System, highlighting component interactions, external integrations, and infrastructure details.

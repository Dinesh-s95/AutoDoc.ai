=== External System Connections and Integrations

The Identity Provider system integrates with external identity providers to facilitate OAuth and OpenID Connect functionalities. This integration allows the system to authenticate users based on external credentials.

=== Component Interaction Overview

The system is built on a microservices architecture pattern, utilizing Spring Boot for the orchestration of business logic through RESTful services. The `UserController` handles all user-related operations and communicates with the `UserService` for business logic, which in turn interacts with the `UserRepository` for data persistence.

=== Technology Stack and Frameworks Used

- **Spring Boot**: Framework for creating stand-alone, production-grade Spring-based applications.
- **Spring Security**: For authentication and access-control.
- **JWT**: For secure transmission of user credentials.
- **Hibernate**: For ORM and database interaction.
- **MySQL**: As the relational database.
- **JUnit**: For unit testing.

== 2. Component Description

=== IdentityproviderApplication

The entry point of the Spring Boot application, responsible for bootstrapping and launching the application.

=== JwtAuthFilter

A component that intercepts HTTP requests to perform JWT-based authentication.

=== SecurityConfig

Configures security-related aspects such as authentication managers, JWT filters, and security filters.

=== UserController

Exposes REST endpoints for user authentication (`/login`) and registration (`/register`). It utilizes `AuthenticationManager` and `JWTService` for processing the operations.

=== UserService

Handles all business logic related to user management, including user registration and loading user details. It interacts with `UserRepository` for database operations and `EmailService` for sending notifications.

=== JWTService

Responsible for all operations related to JWT, including token generation, extraction, validation, and invalidation. It interacts with `AuditService` for logging and `TokenBlacklistService` for managing blacklisted tokens.

== 3. Infrastructure Architecture

=== Deployment Architecture

The application is containerized using Docker, facilitating easy deployment and scalability. Kubernetes is used for orchestration, managing the deployment and scaling of application containers across a cluster of machines.

=== Database Architecture

MySQL is used as the primary data store. It is designed with tables for `Users`, `Roles`, `Clients`, and `Tokens`, each represented as entities in the application.

=== Security Architecture

Security is enforced using Spring Security, which provides comprehensive security services for authentication and authorization via custom security expressions and method-level security.

=== Network Architecture

The application is deployed within a VPC with subnets across multiple availability zones to ensure high availability and fault tolerance. Security groups and NACLs are used to ensure that only authorized traffic can access the application.

== 4. System Context

=== External Systems and Their Interfaces

The system interacts with external identity providers via OAuth and OpenID Connect protocols, allowing it to authenticate users against external systems.

=== Data Flow Between Systems

User credentials are received at the `UserController`, passed through the `UserService` for validation, and then JWT tokens are generated by `JWTService`. These tokens are then used for subsequent requests for authentication and authorization.

=== Authentication and Authorization Flows at System Level

Authentication is initiated through the `/login` endpoint, handled by `UserController`, which uses `AuthenticationManager` to authenticate credentials against stored user details. Upon successful authentication, `JWTService` issues a token which is used to manage sessions and authorize further user actions.

This document provides a detailed overview of the architecture and should serve as a guide for further development, deployment, and maintenance of the Identity Provider system.

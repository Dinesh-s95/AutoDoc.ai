= Identity Provider System Architecture Design

This document provides a comprehensive overview of the architecture for the Identity Provider system, designed using Java Spring Boot. The system is structured to handle user authentication and authorization through JWT (JSON Web Tokens).

=== External System Connections and Integrations

The system integrates with external authentication providers to validate user credentials and generate JWTs for authenticated sessions.

=== Component Interaction Overview

- `UserController` interacts with `UserService` to handle user data operations.
- `UserService` interacts with `UserRepository` for database operations.
- `JWTService` is used by `UserController` to generate and validate JWTs.
- `SecurityConfig` configures security aspects, including the JWT filter managed by `JwtAuthFilter`.

=== Technology Stack and Frameworks Used

- **Language**: Java
- **Framework**: Spring Boot
- **Security**: Spring Security, JWT
- **Database**: JPA (Hibernate)
- **Logging**: SLF4J
- **Testing**: Spring Boot Test

== 2. Component Description

=== IdentityproviderApplication

- **Responsibility**: Bootstraps the Spring Boot application.
- **Role**: Entry point of the application.
- **Interaction**: Initiates the Spring context and all other components.

=== JwtAuthFilter

- **Responsibility**: Intercepts HTTP requests to validate JWTs.
- **Role**: Security filter to ensure only authenticated requests proceed.
- **Interaction**: Uses `UserService` to load user details during authentication.

=== SecurityConfig

- **Responsibility**: Configures security settings for the application.
- **Role**: Defines beans for authentication and authorization mechanisms.
- **Interaction**: Sets up `JwtAuthFilter` and interacts with `UserDetailsService`.

=== UserController

- **Responsibility**: Handles all user-related HTTP requests.
- **Role**: Controller to manage authentication and user registration.
- **Interaction**: Uses `AuthenticationManager`, `JWTService`, and `UserService` to perform operations.

=== UserService

- **Responsibility**: Manages business logic for user operations.
- **Role**: Service layer to abstract logic from the controller.
- **Interaction**: Interacts with `UserRepository` for data persistence.

=== UserRepository

- **Responsibility**: Interface for database operations related to `Users`.
- **Role**: Repository pattern to abstract database interactions.
- **Interaction**: Communicates with the database to fetch or update user data.

=== JWTService

- **Responsibility**: Handles creation and validation of JWTs.
- **Role**: Service to manage JWT operations.
- **Interaction**: Interacts with external systems for token generation and validation.

== 3. Infrastructure Architecture

=== Deployment Architecture

The application is containerized using Docker, allowing it to be deployed on any Docker-compatible environment, including Kubernetes clusters for better scalability and management.

=== Database Architecture

The system uses a relational database managed by JPA (Hibernate). `Users` is the main entity, storing user credentials and details.

=== Security Architecture

Security is managed using Spring Security, configuring authentication via JWTs. HTTPS is enforced for all communications.

=== Network Architecture

The application is designed to be deployed within a secure VPC, with firewalled subnets controlling access to the database and external interfaces.

== 4. System Context

=== External Systems and Their Interfaces

The system interacts with external authentication providers through secure APIs to validate user credentials and generate tokens.

=== Data Flow Between Systems

1. User credentials are received and validated against external systems.
2. Upon successful validation, a JWT is generated and returned to the user.
3. Subsequent requests include the JWT, which is validated by `JwtAuthFilter`.

=== Authentication and Authorization Flows at System Level

Authentication is initiated through `UserController`, which uses `AuthenticationManager` to validate credentials. Upon success, `JWTService` generates a token, which is then used to authorize further requests via `JwtAuthFilter`.

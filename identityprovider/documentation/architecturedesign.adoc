=== External System Connections and Integrations

The Identity Provider System interacts with external systems for authentication and authorization purposes. It integrates with databases for user data storage and utilizes JWT for token-based authentication.

=== Component Interaction Overview

The components within the system interact as follows:
- UserController communicates with UserService, JWTService, and AuthenticationManager.
- UserService interacts with UserRepository and BCryptPasswordEncoder.
- JwtAuthFilter collaborates with UserService.
- SecurityConfig utilizes JwtAuthFilter and UserDetailsService.

=== Technology Stack and Frameworks Used

The system is built using Java Spring Boot framework. Key technologies and frameworks include:
- Spring Boot
- Spring Security
- JWT (JSON Web Token)
- Hibernate
- BCryptPasswordEncoder

== Component Description

=== UserController

The UserController is a REST controller responsible for handling user-related endpoints. It interacts with UserService for user operations, JWTService for token management, and AuthenticationManager for authentication.

=== UserService

The UserService component manages user-related operations such as user registration and user details retrieval. It interacts with UserRepository for database operations and BCryptPasswordEncoder for password encoding.

=== JwtAuthFilter

The JwtAuthFilter component is responsible for filtering and validating JWT tokens. It collaborates with UserService to perform token validation.

=== SecurityConfig

SecurityConfig is responsible for configuring security settings within the application. It utilizes JwtAuthFilter for token filtering and UserDetailsService for user details retrieval.

=== UserRepository

The UserRepository component handles database operations related to user entities.

=== JWTService

JWTService manages JWT token generation, validation, and extraction. It uses a cryptographic key for token operations.

== Infrastructure Architecture

=== Deployment Architecture

The Identity Provider System is deployed as a Spring Boot application on a cloud-based server environment. It follows a microservices architecture for scalability and flexibility.

=== Database Architecture

The system utilizes a relational database to store user information securely. Hibernate ORM is used for database interaction.

=== Security Architecture

Security within the system is managed using Spring Security framework. JWT tokens are used for authentication and authorization purposes.

=== Network Architecture

The system communicates over HTTP protocols for client-server interactions. Secure connections are established using HTTPS for data encryption.

== System Context

=== External Systems and Their Interfaces

The Identity Provider System interfaces with external systems for user authentication and authorization. It communicates with client applications over RESTful APIs for user management operations.

=== Data Flow Between Systems

Data flows between the Identity Provider System and external systems through secure API calls. User information is exchanged securely using JWT tokens.

=== Authentication and Authorization Flows at System Level

Authentication and authorization are managed at the system level using Spring Security configurations. JWT tokens are issued for user authentication and access control.

== Conclusion

The Identity Provider System architecture is designed to provide secure and efficient user authentication and authorization services. By leveraging Spring Boot and related frameworks, the system ensures robust security measures and seamless integration with external systems.

= Identity Provider Service Architecture Design

This document provides a comprehensive architecture design for the Identity Provider Service, a Java Spring Boot application designed to handle user authentication and authorization.

=== External System Connections and Integrations

The Identity Provider Service integrates with the following external systems:

- **Database System**: Connects to a relational database for storing user credentials and other related information.
- **Logging System**: Integrates with a centralized logging system for audit and traceability.

=== Component Interaction Overview

The application components interact primarily through Spring-managed beans. `UserController` handles incoming HTTP requests, interacting with `UserService` for business logic, which in turn uses `UserRepository` for data persistence. `JWTService` is used for JWT token management. `SecurityConfig` configures HTTP security, leveraging `JwtAuthFilter` for request filtering based on JWT tokens.

=== Technology Stack and Frameworks Used

- **Programming Language**: Java
- **Core Framework**: Spring Boot
- **Security**: Spring Security
- **Persistence**: Spring Data JPA
- **Database**: MySQL or PostgreSQL
- **Build Tool**: Maven

== 2. Component Description

=== IdentityproviderApplication

**Responsibility**: Acts as the bootstrap class that runs the Spring Boot application.

**Role**: Entry point of the application, responsible for setting up the Spring context and configurations.

=== UserController

**Responsibility**: Manages all user-related endpoints.

**Role**: Handles HTTP requests for user authentication (`/login`) and registration (`/register`).

=== UserService

**Responsibility**: Contains business logic related to user management.

**Role**: Interacts with `UserRepository` to retrieve and store user data. Provides user details to Spring Security.

=== UserRepository

**Responsibility**: Interface for database operations related to `Users` entity.

**Role**: Extends Spring Data JPA repository, providing CRUD operations on the user table.

=== JWTService

**Responsibility**: Manages JWT token creation and validation.

**Role**: Generates JWT tokens, extracts usernames from tokens, and validates token integrity.

=== SecurityConfig

**Responsibility**: Configures security aspects of the application.

**Role**: Sets up authentication manager, authentication provider, and security filters including JWT authentication filter.

=== JwtAuthFilter

**Responsibility**: Filters incoming requests to check for valid JWT tokens.

**Role**: Intercepts HTTP requests and checks for the presence of a valid JWT in the header.

== 3. Infrastructure Architecture

=== Deployment Architecture

The application is containerized using Docker, allowing it to be deployed on any Docker-compatible environment, including Kubernetes clusters for better scalability and management.

=== Database Architecture

The application uses a relational database (MySQL or PostgreSQL) with tables primarily for users. It uses JPA for ORM and transaction management.

=== Security Architecture

Security is managed using Spring Security, configuring both authentication and authorization. Passwords are stored in hashed formats using BCrypt, and JWT tokens are used for stateless authentication.

=== Network Architecture

The application is deployed within a private subnet with controlled access. Only HTTP(S) traffic is allowed through a load balancer, and database connections are restricted to the application subnet.

== 4. System Context

=== External Systems and Their Interfaces

- **Database**: Accessed via JDBC with connections pooled for efficiency.
- **Logging System**: Integration via SLF4J with potential backends like Logstash or Splunk.

=== Data Flow Between Systems

1. User sends login/register request.
2. `UserController` processes the request, interacting with `UserService`.
3. `UserService` accesses `UserRepository` to fetch/save user data.
4. Responses are generated and sent back to the user, possibly with a JWT token for authentication.

=== Authentication and Authorization Flows at System Level

1. User submits credentials.
2. Credentials are validated against stored records in the database.
3. On successful authentication, a JWT token is generated and returned.
4. The token is used in subsequent requests for authorization via `JwtAuthFilter`.

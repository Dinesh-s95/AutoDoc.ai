= Identity Provider System Architecture Design

This document provides a comprehensive architecture design for the Identity Provider system, developed using Java Spring Boot. The system is designed to manage user authentication and authorization through a secure and scalable web service.

== 1. Service Architecture Overview

=== External System Connections and Integrations

The Identity Provider system integrates with external systems primarily for user authentication requests. These systems interact with the UserController to initiate login and registration processes.

=== Component Interaction Overview

The system components interact as follows:
- **UserController** handles incoming HTTP requests, interacting with UserService for user data operations and JWTService for token operations.
- **UserService** performs business logic operations related to user data and interacts with UserRepository to retrieve or update user details in the database.
- **JWTService** is responsible for generating and validating JWT tokens used for user authentication.
- **SecurityConfig** configures security aspects of the application, including URL access patterns and security filters.
- **JwtAuthFilter** is a security filter that intercepts requests to check for valid JWT tokens.

=== Technology Stack and Frameworks Used

- **Spring Boot**: Framework for building stand-alone, production-grade Spring based Applications.
- **Spring Security**: Provides authentication and authorization support.
- **Spring Data JPA**: Simplifies data access operations.
- **JWT (JSON Web Token)**: Used for securely transmitting information between parties as a JSON object.
- **MySQL**: Database for storing user data.
- **JUnit**: For unit testing of application components.

== 2. Component Description

=== IdentityproviderApplication

**Responsibility**: Bootstraps the Spring Boot application.

**Role**: Entry point of the application, responsible for setting up the Spring ApplicationContext and launching the application.

=== UserController

**Responsibility**: Handles all user-related HTTP requests.

**Role**: Acts as a controller to manage registration, login, and user greeting. It interacts with UserService for business operations and JWTService for authentication token operations.

=== UserService

**Responsibility**: Manages business logic for user operations.

**Role**: Communicates with UserRepository to access and modify user data. It also handles user authentication and registration logic.

=== UserRepository

**Responsibility**: Interface for database operations related to user data.

**Role**: Extends JpaRepository to interact with the database and perform CRUD operations on the Users entity.

=== JWTService

**Responsibility**: Manages JWT token operations.

**Role**: Generates, extracts, and validates JWT tokens to support authentication processes.

=== SecurityConfig

**Responsibility**: Configures security settings for the application.

**Role**: Sets up authentication manager, authentication provider, and security filters to secure the application.

=== JwtAuthFilter

**Responsibility**: Filters incoming requests for valid JWT tokens.

**Role**: Intercepts HTTP requests to check for the presence and validity of authentication tokens.

== 3. Infrastructure Architecture

=== Deployment Architecture

The application is packaged as a jar and can be deployed on any Java-capable server environment, including cloud platforms like AWS or Azure.

=== Database Architecture

The system uses MySQL as the relational database to store user data, including usernames and encrypted passwords.

=== Security Architecture

Security is enforced using Spring Security, which handles authentication and authorization. Passwords are stored in an encrypted format using BCrypt.

=== Network Architecture

The application is accessible over HTTP/HTTPS. Security measures such as firewalls and SSL/TLS should be configured to protect data in transit.

== 4. System Context

=== External Systems and Their Interfaces

The Identity Provider system interfaces with external client applications primarily through REST API endpoints exposed by UserController.

=== Data Flow Between Systems

External systems interact with the Identity Provider system by sending HTTP requests to the UserController endpoints. UserController uses UserService and JWTService to process these requests and respond appropriately.

=== Authentication and Authorization Flows at System Level

Authentication is performed using JWT tokens. Upon a successful login, a JWT token is generated and returned to the client, which must include it in subsequent requests to access protected resources.

== Conclusion

This document outlines the architecture of the Identity Provider system, detailing component responsibilities, interactions, and the overall infrastructure setup. This architecture is designed to ensure a secure, scalable, and maintainable system for managing user authentication and authorization.

= Identity Provider Service Architecture Design

This document provides a comprehensive architecture design for the Identity Provider Service, which is built using Java Spring Boot. The design includes a high-level system overview, detailed component descriptions, infrastructure architecture, and system context.

== 1. Service Architecture Overview

=== External System Connections and Integrations

The Identity Provider Service integrates with an external database system for user data storage. Additionally, it can be configured to integrate with other systems for additional functionalities such as email services for user verification, logging services, and more.

=== Component Interaction Overview

The application is centered around the `UserController`, which handles all user-related operations. `UserController` interacts with `UserService` for business logic and data retrieval, which in turn interacts with `UserRepository` to perform database operations. Authentication and security are managed by `SecurityConfig`, which utilizes `JwtAuthFilter` for JWT token handling.

=== Technology Stack and Frameworks Used

- **Programming Language:** Java
- **Framework:** Spring Boot
- **Security:** Spring Security, JWT
- **Database:** Relational Database (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL)
- **Build Tool:** Maven or Gradle
- **Version Control:** Git

== 2. Component Description

=== IdentityproviderApplication

The entry point of the application, responsible for bootstrapping and launching the Spring Boot application.

=== JwtAuthFilter

A component that intercepts HTTP requests to check for the presence of a JWT token. It uses `UserService` to authenticate tokens and users.

=== SecurityConfig

Configures security aspects of the application, including URL access rules, authentication providers, and the security filter chain.

=== UserController

Handles all incoming HTTP requests related to user operations such as login and registration. It interacts with `AuthenticationManager`, `JWTService`, and `UserService`.

=== JWTService

Provides services related to JWT, including token generation, extraction, and validation.

=== UserService

Contains business logic related to user management. It interacts with `UserRepository` for data persistence.

=== UserRepository

Spring Data repository that abstracts database interactions for user data.

=== Users

Entity class representing a user in the system. It is managed by JPA and persisted in a relational database.

== 3. Infrastructure Architecture

=== Deployment Architecture

The application is containerized using Docker, allowing it to be deployed on any Docker-compatible environment, including Kubernetes clusters for better scalability and management.

=== Database Architecture

The application uses a relational database for storing user data. Database schema is managed through Hibernate ORM with Spring Data JPA.

=== Security Architecture

Security is enforced through Spring Security, configuring both authentication and authorization mechanisms. Passwords are stored in hashed formats using BCrypt.

=== Network Architecture

The application is deployed within a private network with controlled access. Communication between services and the database is secured using network policies and TLS encryption.

== 4. System Context

=== External Systems and Their Interfaces

The system interacts with:
- **Database Systems:** For persistent storage of user data.
- **Email Systems:** (Optional) For sending notifications and confirmations to users.

=== Data Flow Between Systems

User data flows from the `UserController` to `UserService` and then to `UserRepository`, which interacts with the database. Authentication data flows through `JwtAuthFilter` and is verified using `JWTService`.

=== Authentication and Authorization Flows at System Level

Authentication is performed using JWT tokens generated by `JWTService` upon successful login. `JwtAuthFilter` validates these tokens for each request. Authorization is managed by Spring Security based on user roles and permissions defined in the security configuration.

This architecture document provides a clear, high-level overview of the Identity Provider Service, suitable for use by architects and senior developers to understand and potentially enhance the system design.

= Identity Provider System Architecture Documentation

This document provides a comprehensive architectural overview of the Identity Provider system, designed using Java Spring Boot. The system facilitates user authentication and authorization through JWT (JSON Web Tokens) and integrates with a database for user management.

=== External System Connections and Integrations

The system integrates with:
- A relational database for storing user credentials and other relevant data.
- External systems for user data synchronization (not detailed in the class summary).

=== Component Interaction Overview

The `UserController` handles incoming HTTP requests, interacting with `UserService` for business logic, which in turn uses `JWTService` for token operations and `UserRepository` for database interactions. `SecurityConfig` configures security aspects and `JwtAuthFilter` is used for request filtering based on JWT.

=== Technology Stack and Frameworks Used

- **Spring Boot**: Framework for creating stand-alone, production-grade Spring based applications.
- **Spring Security**: For authentication and authorization.
- **JWT**: For secure transmission of user credentials.
- **Hibernate**: For ORM.
- **MySQL**: As the relational database.

== 2. Component Description

=== IdentityproviderApplication

- **Responsibility**: Bootstraps the Spring Boot application.
- **Role**: Entry point of the application.
- **Interaction**: Initializes the Spring context and all other components.

=== UserController

- **Responsibility**: Handle HTTP requests related to user operations.
- **Role**: Controller in MVC pattern.
- **Interaction**: Uses `AuthenticationManager` and `JWTService` for authentication and token operations, and `UserService` for user management.

=== UserService

- **Responsibility**: Business logic for user management.
- **Role**: Service layer component.
- **Interaction**: Interacts with `UserRepository` for database operations and `JWTService` for token management.

=== JWTService

- **Responsibility**: Handling JWT operations like creation, extraction, and validation.
- **Role**: Service layer component.
- **Interaction**: Interacts with `Users` entity for fetching user details.

=== UserRepository

- **Responsibility**: Interface for database operations related to `Users`.
- **Role**: Repository pattern.
- **Interaction**: Communicates directly with the database.

=== SecurityConfig

- **Responsibility**: Configuration of security settings.
- **Role**: Security configuration.
- **Interaction**: Sets up `JwtAuthFilter` and authentication mechanisms.

=== JwtAuthFilter

- **Responsibility**: Filter to intercept requests and perform JWT validation.
- **Role**: Security filter.
- **Interaction**: Uses `UserService` to load user details during authentication.

== 3. Infrastructure Architecture

=== Deployment Architecture

The application is packaged as a Docker container, allowing it to be deployed on any Docker-compatible environment, including cloud platforms like AWS, Azure, and GCP.

=== Database Architecture

The system uses MySQL as its database. The `Users` table stores user credentials and related information. Hibernate is used for ORM.

=== Security Architecture

Security is managed using Spring Security, configuring HTTP security, CSRF protection, and CORS policies. `JwtAuthFilter` ensures that only valid JWTs can access protected routes.

=== Network Architecture

The application is deployed within a VPC with controlled access to the internet and other internal services. Security groups and network ACLs are used to enforce security at the network level.

== 4. System Context

=== External Systems and Their Interfaces

The system interacts with external systems for services like email notifications and external audits. These interactions are secured using API keys and mutual TLS where applicable.

=== Data Flow Between Systems

User data flows from the client applications through the `UserController` to the `UserService` and then to the database. Responses flow back through the same path enriched with JWTs for authentication.

=== Authentication and Authorization Flows at System Level

Authentication is initiated at the `UserController`, which delegates to `AuthenticationManager`. Upon successful authentication, `JWTService` generates a token that is returned to the user. This token is then used for subsequent requests, validated by `JwtAuthFilter`.

This document serves as a high-level overview for architects and senior developers to understand and evaluate the system design and its components.

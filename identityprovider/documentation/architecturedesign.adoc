== Introduction

This document provides a comprehensive architecture design for the Identity Provider system, developed using Java Spring Boot. The system is designed to manage user authentication and authorization through JWT (JSON Web Tokens) and integrates with external systems for enhanced security and user management capabilities.

=== External System Connections and Integrations

The Identity Provider system integrates with external authentication providers to support various authentication mechanisms. It also connects to a centralized user database for user management and verification.

=== Component Interaction Overview

Components interact primarily through Spring-managed beans. `UserController` handles incoming HTTP requests, interacting with `UserService` for business logic and `JWTService` for token operations. `UserService` accesses `UserRepository` for database operations. `SecurityConfig` configures security aspects and integrates `JwtAuthFilter` for request filtering based on JWT.

=== Technology Stack and Frameworks Used

* **Programming Language:** Java
* **Framework:** Spring Boot
* **Security:** Spring Security, JWT
* **Database:** MySQL (or any SQL database)
* **Build Tool:** Maven
* **Version Control:** Git

== Component Description

=== IdentityproviderApplication

* **Responsibility:** Bootstraps the Spring Boot application.
* **Role:** Entry point of the application.
* **Interaction:** Initiates all other components.

=== JwtAuthFilter

* **Responsibility:** Filters HTTP requests to check for valid JWT in the header.
* **Role:** Ensures security by enabling JWT based authentication.
* **Interaction:** Uses `UserService` to authenticate tokens.

=== SecurityConfig

* **Responsibility:** Configures security aspects of the application.
* **Role:** Sets up authentication and authorization mechanisms.
* **Interaction:** Integrates `JwtAuthFilter` and interacts with external authentication providers.

=== UserController

* **Responsibility:** Handles all user-related HTTP requests.
* **Role:** Acts as a controller to manage login and registration.
* **Interaction:** Utilizes `AuthenticationManager`, `JWTService`, and `UserService` to process authentication and registration.

=== UserService

* **Responsibility:** Manages all business logic related to user operations.
* **Role:** Core service for user details loading and registration.
* **Interaction:** Interacts with `UserRepository` for database operations and `JWTService` for token-related operations.

=== JWTService

* **Responsibility:** Manages JWT creation and validation.
* **Role:** Service provider for token operations.
* **Interaction:** Used by `UserController` and `JwtAuthFilter` for processing and validating tokens.

=== UserRepository

* **Responsibility:** Interface for database operations related to users.
* **Role:** DAO (Data Access Object) for user entities.
* **Interaction:** Directly interacts with the database to perform CRUD operations on user data.

== Infrastructure Architecture

=== Deployment Architecture

The application is containerized using Docker, facilitating easy deployment and scalability. It is deployed on Kubernetes clusters for better load management and high availability.

=== Database Architecture

The system uses a relational database (MySQL) to store user credentials and information. The database schema is managed through Hibernate ORM with Spring Data JPA.

=== Security Architecture

Security is enforced through Spring Security, configuring both authentication and authorization. Passwords are stored in hashed formats using BCrypt. HTTPS is enforced for all communications.

=== Network Architecture

The application is deployed within a private subnet with controlled access via load balancers. Communication between services within the cluster is secured using internal networking features of Kubernetes.

== System Context

=== External Systems and Their Interfaces

The system interfaces with external authentication providers through standard protocols such as OAuth2. It also communicates with email services for sending notifications and verifications.

=== Data Flow Between Systems

Authentication data flows from the client to `UserController`, which then interacts with `UserService` and `JWTService` to validate credentials and generate tokens. User data is retrieved and stored via `UserRepository`.

=== Authentication and Authorization Flows at System Level

Authentication is performed using username and password, validated against stored credentials in the database. Upon successful authentication, a JWT is generated and returned to the user. This token is then used for subsequent requests to authenticate via `JwtAuthFilter`.

== Conclusion

This architecture document outlines the design and structure of the Identity Provider system, detailing component responsibilities, interactions, and the overall infrastructure setup. It serves as a guide for further development, deployment, and maintenance of the system.

### Explanation

1. **Overview Section**: The API title, version, and base path are defined at the top of the document. General usage guidance is provided in the description.

2. **OpenAPI Specification**:
   - **Endpoints**: Each method in the `UserController` is documented with HTTP methods, request bodies, and response formats.
   - **Schemas**: `Users` and `AuthResponse` schemas are defined under `components.schemas` to standardize the request and response structures.
   - **Responses**: Standard HTTP status codes are used to describe possible responses, including success and error scenarios.

3. **Security**: A JWT-based security scheme is defined under `components.securitySchemes` and applied globally to all endpoints.

This YAML is structured to be human-readable and is ready for use in tools like Swagger Editor, API Gateway, or Postman.

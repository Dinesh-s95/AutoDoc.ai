Below is a comprehensive ADOC document that includes an introduction to the API, a complete OpenAPI 3.0 YAML specification, and detailed API documentation based on the provided Java REST controller classes.

= Identity Provider API Documentation

== Introduction

This API provides authentication and user management services for applications. It allows for user registration, login, and simple greeting endpoints.

=== Authentication Requirements

The API uses JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for securing endpoints. Clients must authenticate by providing a valid JWT in the `Authorization` header of their HTTP requests.

=== Base URL and Versioning

The base URL for all API endpoints is `https://api.example.com/v1`. This documentation refers to version 1 of the API.

=== How to Use This Specification

This specification is written in the OpenAPI 3.0 format and can be imported into tools like Swagger UI, Postman, or Insomnia for testing and interaction with the API.

== API Documentation

=== Endpoint Descriptions and Usage Examples

==== Login

Endpoint to authenticate a user and retrieve a token.

Request:
[source,json]
----
{
  "username": "user@example.com",
  "password": "password123"
}
----

Response:
[source,json]
----
{
  "token": "eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9..."
}
----

==== Greet

Endpoint to receive a simple greeting message.

Response:
[source,text]
----
Hello, user!
----

==== Register

Endpoint to register a new user.

Request:
[source,json]
----
{
  "username": "newuser@example.com",
  "password": "newpassword123"
}
----

Response:
[source,json]
----
{
  "userId": 1,
  "username": "newuser@example.com"
}
----

=== Authentication Flows

Users must authenticate using the `/login` endpoint to receive a JWT. This token must be included in the `Authorization` header as `Bearer <token>` for subsequent requests to protected endpoints.

=== Common Error Codes and Their Meanings

- `401 Unauthorized`: Authentication failed due to invalid credentials or token.
- `400 Bad Request`: The request was invalid or missing required fields.
- `500 Internal Server Error`: An unexpected error occurred on the server.

=== Rate Limiting Information

Currently, there is no rate limiting enforced on the API endpoints. However, this may be subject to change as the API evolves.

This document provides a comprehensive guide to interacting with the Identity Provider API, ensuring that developers can effectively integrate and utilize its features.
